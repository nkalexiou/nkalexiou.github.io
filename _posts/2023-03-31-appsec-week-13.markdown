### Parts of Twitter's source code leaked

Twitter announced that parts of its source code were leaked by an unknown person in a Github public repository, resulting in a copyright infringement notice being sent to Github and asking the removal of the repository. The repository was taken down soon after the leak. Twitter is now also asking for data coupled to the Github account that might help authorities identify the person behind the leak, such as IP addresses, account information etc. It is hard to know whether the information disclosure will result in a security risk for Twitter users. It is also worth noting that earlier this month, Elon Musk promised to make limited parts of Twitter's source code public.

### ENISA publishes Foresight Cybersecurity Threats 2030

ENISA, the european agency for cybersecurity published its report on cybersecurity threats for the midterm. It is a really interesting perception of the future landscape of threats as it deviates from the classic list of threats, because it considers political, economic and social aspects among others. Supply chain compromise of software dependencies tops the list of threats, while at the end of the list we find Artificial intelligence abuse. Disinformation campaigns and the rise of digital surveilance are also part of the threat list.
