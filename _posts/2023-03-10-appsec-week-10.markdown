### OWASP Secure Champions Guide

Using security champions is a way to accelerate adoptions of DevSecOps and security practices, while pushing security left.

I personally feel this is a misunderstood topic that is often treated with scepticism and regularly applied incorrectly. This is a must-read for every application security person out there already trying or considering to establish a security champions program.
